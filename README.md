Self-Research 1 - Code Submission
This repository contrains the code implementation for Self-Research 1.
A project focused on the implementation and experimentation of Computer Vision Models.

Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to explore the performance and characteristics of various deep learning models in the context of computer vision tasks. The models implemented in this project are :

ResNet : A deep residual network aimed at solving the degradation problem in deep learning models by introducing residual connections.
Vision Transformer(ViT) : A transformer-based model applied to image classification, exploring its performance compared to CNN-based architectures.
ViT Pretrained : An evaluation of pretrained Vision Transformer models implemented using the timm library.
further experiments and results will be added in future updates....
Each model has been implemented and tested on standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet1k) to compare performance metrics such as accuracy and error rates.
